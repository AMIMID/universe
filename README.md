  Universe is a generative algorithmic additive synthesis SynthDef architecture conceptualizeing an animatronic and auditory timeline of the cosmos,
utilizing harmonics, sound art, controled randomness, music theory, spatial sound and quaternions. The generative synth can be used as standalone via percussive envelopes in quad, 
cubic or 12 channel sound installations (VBAP),or as a drone with parallel Midiout via AM/FM with the addition of external synths 
like the Vermona Perfourmer or other Behringer modules and sequencers, for drum and bass generative techno setups.

//
The conceptual framework of the composition is a Kepler Mysterium Cosmagraphic auditory and partly visual in computer generative graphics. Pairing with doku aesthetiv video visual content is conceptually an itnerest. The conceptio is modernized in atempt as influenced are of contemporary media theory and open source mathematic and science.

 Array indormation for cosmic spherical objects control arrays and harmonics (Ambisonics, Bessel etc.) with their mappings to polytope geometric interpolations.
-sculptor(music) which is the code bundle for additioin with external synths and midiout
-animation and digital image.
