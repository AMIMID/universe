This branch contains the sub branches responsible for the algorithmic building blogs and categories of the composition in general in
SuperCollider with no external equipment, with MathLib and SC extensions (VBAP) as installed prerequisites.
These branches are the synth category, data and coordinate arrays, and routines aka patterns and tasks.


Note that execution of the code and evaluating the final result needs an understanding of the code and concept in general as there is no guidance in executio order.
a single executable scd file will be created in time on this branch containsing a version of the whole composition compiled manually from its parts in the sub branchses.
