  Universe is a generative algorithmic additive synthesis with Task, Pattern, Routine, SynthDef architecture conceptualizeing an animation and auditory timeline of the cosmos,
utilizing harmonics, sound art, control randomness, music theory, spatial sound and quaternions. The generative synth can be used as standalone with percussive envelopes in quad, 
cubic or 12 channel sound installations (VBAP),or as a drone with parallel Midiout and AM/FM with the addition of external synths 
like the Vermona Perfourmer or other Behringer modules and sequencers, for drum and bass generative techno setups.
