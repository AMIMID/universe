This branch contains two main sub branches control-arrays and material-arrays. Arrays are modulated spherical tensor data used by 
the sSynthdef arguments routine control channels and the backbone of the composition in general. 
Control arrays are ment for algorithmic msusical (rhythmic, tonal) control for the synth. They are a distribution data set 3d tensors which, via neighbour proximity point analysis iteration algorithm set and select data from the material arrays.
Material arrays are the cosmographic objects as moduled in 3d tensors, these are the cosmso in general, stars/supermassive black holes/galaxies
suns/solar systems.
All array distributions have an analogous geometric interpolation via polytope compounds and platonic solids so that geodesic geometries
can set symmetries in spatiality and composition also via proximith area point selection ranging from a max limit to the min limit being the related polytope vertex, considering the cosmographic timeline, astronomic object point etc.
