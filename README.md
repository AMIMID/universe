Thia branch contains some equipment sound installation setup, notes and relevant imagery that can conecptuallize the actuall

In any case transcription of the vbap channel ouput to b-format is crucual, unless the stereo version is more experimentally generated thourgh other or cruder methodes, of simple mix and match.
