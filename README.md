Material arrays contain the tensor arrays correspondent to the composition cosmographical objects like the cosmos/heat death/bigbang, first stars/super massive black holes/ galaxies and suns/solar systems/black masses(holes).
Each array has its own geometric interpolations according to relevant polytope compounds as hull and cors. Eg. in the case of the solar system the core is the sun and the hull are the planets. And magnitude iteration setting must be se accordinglingly following a silver ratio interval.
These arrays change in form and are modulated via spherical harmonics (nebula conept) their proximity point area mapping geometric interpolation.
And set the arguments of the synth accordingly.
